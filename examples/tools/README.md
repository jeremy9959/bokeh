The examples in this directory illustrate the use of some tools that can assist in the
development of bokeh plots.  Currently this includes:

* a tool for constructing the directed acyclic graph of submodels of a bokeh model, and
drawing that graph to illuminate the model structure. Clicking on the node of the graph associated with
a submodel reveals the attributes of that submodel.  See [this jupyter notebook](./ModelStructureExample.ipynb)
or run:

```
$ python structure_graph.py
```
